## The App

The repo is a simple client/server booking system. The client is impolemented using Angular and the server using Nodejs.
Sqlite was used as a simple database, with Typeorm.

The user can go to the app and register, then he/she will be redirected to the booking page where the app detect
the user's location and search for properties near this user.

2. Use a more production like database (Mysql)
